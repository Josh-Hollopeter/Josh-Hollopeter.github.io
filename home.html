<h2> One equals sign or two? </h2>

<p class ="main">

  The difference between = and == is pretty major. A single = sets a
  variable to a value. For example x = 5 means x is 5 now. From here if I said
  x == 5 that would now be "true". This is because == checks for equality.
  If you wanted an IF statement to be able to check if someones input matched an
  item in an array? That would be the perfect time to use the double equals sign ==.
  Want to initialize a variable? This is the time to use a single equals sign =.

<h2> What's my level of experience as I started this program? </h2>

<p class ="main"> This will be an interesting thing to archive, years from now it will be
  motivating to look back and see where it all started. I understand the basics at
  this point, while loops, for loops, if statements all make sense to me. I have trouble
  currently putting all the pieces together, to really make something incredible.

  <p> The project I am currently most proud of is a text game I made to
  help me understand IF statements it lets a person control a text based character
  to walk around a virtual room. Took me a few hours of struggling to piece it
  together, but I sat there and failed till it worked!</p>
