<h2> One equals sign or two? </h2>

<p class ="main">

  The difference between = and == is pretty major. A single = sets a
  variable to a value. For example x = 5 means x is 5 now. From here if I said
  x == 5 that would now be "true". This is because == checks for equality.
  If you wanted an IF statement to be able to check if someones input matched an
  item in an array? That would be the perfect time to use the double equals sign ==.
  Want to initialize a variable? This is the time to use a single equals sign =.

<h2> What's my level of experience as I start this program? </h2>

<p class ="main"> This will be an interesting thing to archive, years from now it will be
  motivating to look back and see where it all started. I understand the basics at
  this point, while loops, for loops, if statements all make sense to me. I have trouble
  currently putting all the pieces together, to really make something incredible.
  </p>
  <p> The project I am currently most proud of is a text game I made to
  help me understand IF statements. It lets a person control a text based character
  to walk around a virtual room. Took me a few hours of struggling to piece it
  together, but I sat there and failed till it worked!

  <h2> Cast a double to an int </h2>

  <p class="main">
    Casting a double to an int will remove everything after the decimal, it's a
      way to get whole numbers from decimals. The syntax looks like this:
      int value = (int) 5.99; <em> // value is == 5 now </em>. A good time to use
      it would be if you had a game where someone needed 6 points to win and the game
      would need doubles to keep track of the score but only ints to show you your score,
      and process whether you won or not, since you would need <em> at least</em>
     6 points to win.

  <h2> Void vs returning a value </h2>

  <p class ="main"> public static void main... I've typed that a few times over the past week!
    A void method declaration means we don't need a value returned by the code. So if
    we call a void method we don't keep any value outside of the function. Instead if
    I call <em> static int Method (int n) { return 12 * n;} </em>. Whatever number I call
    this function on will be multiplied by 12 and returned to me to use elsewhere.

    <h2> My goal by the end of Skill Distillery</h2>

    <p class ="main"> I want to make programs, mostly I want to be able to use code to
      create. For right now it doesn't matter what I'm creating. It's like having a big
      set of legos, it's just fun to make something. Eventually I would like to create
      games, something along the lines of dark souls which had a profound impact on my
      life.

    <h2> Switch or If/Else </h2>

    <p class ="main"> If else statments check for whether a condition is true or false.
      Switch staments are used to check if any one of multiple conditions are true but
      each case only checks one condition at a time, where with an if statement you can use relational operators
      like (|| <em>or</em>) and (&& <em>and</em>) to check if something and some other thing are true.
      A switch statment is more useful when you have a lot of conditions to check, it helps keep the code
      organized and it will run quicker. If statements are better for fewer conditions, but have the benefit of
      nested conditions which once one thing is true are able to check if from there something else is true.

    <h2> Math class with static method random()</h2>

    <p class="main">
      Math is a class in java, its .random() method returns a double between 0 and 1
      excluding 1. The reason the class name <em> Math</em> is capitalized is to
      differentiate between class and member names.
    </p>

    <h2> Pitfalls </h2>

    <p class ="main">
      Pitfalls I have encountered in my learning have mostly revolved around not
      giving myself enough time to understand something. I have always been too hard
      on myself when I didn't understand a subject immediately. Accountability for
      not giving up is a little easier for me now that I have my own family. I was never
      one to give up or not put the work in to begin with, but having the extra
      incentive is always nice.

    <h2> Parameter vs Argument </h2>

    <p class="main">
      An argument in Java is a  variable inside the parenthesis of a function
      call. For example if I had a function called root and a variable double x = 37;
      I would put something like <em> double answer = root(x);</em> in this
      example x would be an argument. Then whatever variable I used inside the
      root function to get my answer eg <em>root(double y) *rest of function*
      return root of y </em> y in this case would be a parameter.
    </p>

    <h2> Packages, subpackages, and classes </h2>

    <p class="main">
    import java.util.Scanner; means we are accessing the class Scanner inside the
    util subpackage inside the java package. This class enables us to grab user
    input, such as nextInt() which will grab the next integer the user types into the
    keyboard.

    <h2> End of first week at Skill Distillery </h2>

    <p class="main">
      I think the first week here has really helped cement my understanding
      of programming fundamentals, it was helpful to have other students to
      bounce ideas off of to ensure my understanding was where it should be.
      It was excellent having teachers with 20 years of experience, having a
      topic explained by someone with the experience really clarifies the subject
      matter.
